Announcing Full Schedule
========================

Hey everyone!

We're less than a month away from the first ever online Portland conference and we're working hard to make sure it'll be as welcoming and as fun as the in-person event you're probably familar with.

Today we're announcing the full presentation schedule and the onnline platform we'll be hosting the conference on.

Conference platform
--------------------

The conference will be held on https://hopin.to/, which not only provides a stage for our amazing speakers, but also has integrated chat, unconference rooms with breakout calls, and impromptu 1-on-1 meetings. We're updating our welcome guide so it'll all feel familar before you've even arrived.

Full presentation schedule
--------------------------

The conference website is now updated with the `talk schedule <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/schedule/>`_ for the main stage presentations, so you can start planning your time (and getting excited!) for the conference. We're excited to have Q&A after most talks

As always, we'll be running the `unconference <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/unconference/>`_, and `lightning talks <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2019/lightning-talks/>`_ each day after lunch.

You'll be able to sign up for unconference sessions and lightning talks during the conference.


Start thinking about Writing Day
--------------------------------

Our pre-conference `Writing Day <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2019/writing-day/>`_ will happen on Sunday, and it is much more fun when folks come with their own projects in mind!

If you have a project or are part of a community that you think would benefit from a writing sprint, start brainstorming now about what you might want to focus on.
If you'd like us to include your project on the Writing Day page, drop us an email at `portland@writethedocs.org <mailto:portland@writethedocs.org>`_.
Or just show up on Sunday ready to introduce your project!

Thanks so much for all your support and enthusiasm so far â€“ we're so excited to see you all next month!
