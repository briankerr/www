Announcing Full Schedule
========================

Hey everyone!

We're less than a month away from the first ever online Portland conference and we're working hard to make sure it'll be as welcoming and as fun as the in-person event you're probably familar with.

Today we're announcing the full presentation schedule and the onnline platform we'll be hosting the conference on.

Conference platform
--------------------

The conference will be held on https://hopin.to/, which not only provides a stage for our amazing speakers, but also has integrated chat, unconference rooms with breakout calls, and impromptu 1-on-1 meetings. We're updating our welcome guide so it'll all feel familar before you've even arrived.

Full presentation schedule
--------------------------

The conference website is now updated with the `talk schedule <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/schedule/>`_ for the main stage presentations, so you can start planning your time (and getting excited!) for the conference. We're excited to have Q&A after most talks

As always, we'll be running the `unconference <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/unconference/>`_, and `lightning talks <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2019/lightning-talks/>`_ each day after lunch.

You'll be able to sign up for unconference sessions and lightning talks during the conference.


Start thinking about Writing Day
--------------------------------

Our pre-conference `Writing Day <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2019/writing-day/>`_ will happen on Sunday, and it is much more fun when folks come with their own projects in mind!

If you have a project or are part of a community that you think would benefit from a writing sprint, start brainstorming now about what you might want to focus on.
If you'd like us to include your project on the Writing Day page, drop us an email at `portland@writethedocs.org <mailto:portland@writethedocs.org>`_.
Or just show up on Sunday ready to introduce your project!

Shirts on sale
--------------

The Write the Docs Portland 2019 Pop-Up Shop is now open! We have loose and fitted options from different fabrics, and you can choose exactly the size and cut you want!

The campaign will run in 3-day batches until TODO.

Other events and activities
----------------------------

Write the Docs is more than a conference. Every year we make sure to have a variety of activities that our attendees can enjoy, whether you want to learn something, meet new people, or share knowledge. And even though this years conference is held online, we're holding to that plan.

* **Lightning Talks.** We'll have `lightning talks <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/lightning-talks/>`__ each day after lunch. These are 5 minute presentations and a lot of fun. They can be about anything you want, this is your chance to share something you are passionate about with the audience. Slides are not required.
* **Unconference.** We'll be running the `Unconference <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/unconference/>`_ all day Monday and on Tuesday afternoon. Want to chat with like-minded folks about a specific thing? This is the place.
* **Job Fair**. Following last year's great success, on Tuesday morning we'll have a `job fair <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/job-fair>`_ where you can find your next documentarian friendly job.

The `Schedule page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/{{year}}/schedule/>`_ has the latest and most complete information about all our events. This is where we will also update any changes/cancellations if they should occur.

Thanks so much for all your support and enthusiasm so far â€“ we're so excited to see you all next month!

The Write the Docs team
